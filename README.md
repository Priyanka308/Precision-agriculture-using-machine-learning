# Precision-agriculture-using-machine-learning
Precision agriculture, often known as "smart farming," has emerged as a cutting-edge method for addressing current agricultural sustainability concerns. The main objective of the project is to give field owners the ability to monitor and regulate the growth of their plants in their fields. Using developing technologies such as IOT (internet of things) and machine learning, they monitor factors from the field in real time to boost farm productivity and generate the crop field health index. The next agricultural revolution will rely heavily on machine learning and IoT-enabled farm gear. Farms that have not yet invested in data management and analysis tools may be missing out on the potential benefits of leveraging their farm's data for better on-farm decision-making. Using various parameters, the optimized supervised machine learning technique, random forest, is utilized to evaluate whether the plant is healthy or not. Parameters are analyzed graphically to see the changes from day to day. Farmers have used the strategy to increase crop productivity and make informed judgments when the plants are unhealthy.
